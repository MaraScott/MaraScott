### Hi there 👋, I'm David (aka MaraScott)!

🌍 I love to travel the world, having lived in Hong-Kong, Germany, the Netherlands, and now France.

👨‍💼 I'm an IT Manager and GenAI imagery specialist with over 11 years of experience. I previously ran **Maras IT**, a business dedicated to providing high-quality IT support, but have now shifted my focus.

🔨 **Tech Stacks**: 
- Fullstack Development
- Web Hosting & Multi-cloud Infrastructure
- DNS Configurations
- IT Support (WordPress, Microsoft 365, ComfyUI, Stable Diffusion)
- Project Management (LAMP stack, ReactJs, PWA, and more)

🎯 **Current Challenge**: Delivering high-end GenAI image and video services using ComfyUI.
